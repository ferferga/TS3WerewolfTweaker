# WerewolfTweaker

Sources of "Werewolf Tweaker", a mod I started for the Sims 3, but I never finished, neither appeared in ModTheSims website.

These are the unmodified sources (they have been uploaded after I found them in my drive, as they were since I last touched anything on them) of the next mod I had planned for my "Tweaker" series on Sims 3. It never got released, so here you have some stuff to play around if you want.

The sources of my other mod, [Vampire Tweaker](https://github.com/ferferga/VampireTweaker), are also here on GitHub as well. As with Vampire Tweaker, don't hesitate to open an issue or ask me any questions about the mod. I'll help as much as I can.

# WerewolfTweaker

Sources of "Werewolf Tweaker", a mod I started for the Sims 3, but I never finished.

These are the unmodified sources (they have been uploaded after I found them in my drive, as they were since I last touched anything on them) of the next mod I had planned for my "Tweaker" series on Sims 3. It never got released, so here you have some stuff to play around if you want.

The sources of my other mod, [Vampire Tweaker](https://github.com/ferferga/VampireTweaker), are also here on GitHub as well. As with Vampire Tweaker, don't hesitate to open an issue or ask me any questions about the mod. I'll help as much as I can.

Give always credits to original authors and me when you use some of my work. 

**AFAIK** I only took some work of CamKitty here for the WolfFeet effects: [Original Mod](http://www.modthesims.info/download.php?t=530634)
